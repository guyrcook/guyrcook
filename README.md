### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**guyrcook/guyrcook** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
As Vice President of US Route 6 Tourist Association I help with the following statement
"To assist in the economic development of those towns and rural communities located along U.S. Route 6 that may otherwise cease to exist. This is to be done by, but not limited to, seeking out, and/or by providing grants for the preservation and restoration of significant historical structures. Other considerations will include education, health care, the arts, and to promote the desire for new businesses to locate along U.S. Route 6."
